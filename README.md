# Modulo 1 Evaluaci√≥n Final

Hey! Welcome to the ADALAB Module 1 final exam! While it was difficult, I had a lot of fun.
The finished webpage includes HTML, SCSS, responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens, transitions and animations, and is divided into five partials: 
-	Header
-	Hero
-	Window
-	Reasons
-	Footer
